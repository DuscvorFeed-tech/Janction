📦 Project: DMC with JANCTION
-----------------------------

### Overview

**DMC with JANCTION** is a decentralized music data storage and monetization platform built as a sidechain project of _JANCTION_, a public blockchain derived from Japan's IoT-focused **Jasmy** ecosystem.

The project's core philosophy is to "give value to your own data" by enabling content creators and consumers to store, share, and profit from audio data on-chain—without relying on centralized platforms like YouTube or Spotify.

Mytube is a decentralized video distribution platform that aims to offer content creators greater freedom, ownership, and control over their media. Unlike traditional platforms like YouTube, which are centralized and impose strict content regulations, Mytube leverages Web3 principles to return authority to the users.  
This project is part of the broader JANCTION Web3 ecosystem, where Mytube acts as the primary media platform for decentralized content sharing. It is particularly aligned with creators participating in the JANCTION STORIES initiative.  

> Note: The underlying IPFS-based decentralized content distribution technology used by Mytube is documented separately in our IPFS Node Repository.

![:link:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f517.png) Key Features  

*   Decentralized Ownership: Creators retain full rights to their content. Files are stored securely and redundantly via IPFS.
*   DAO-Driven Governance: Managed by community contributors rather than a corporation.
*   Token Incentives: Viewers and creators earn JANCTION POINTS (JCP) through engagement.
*   Freedom of Expression: No censorship of content based on centralized policies.
*   Optimized Storage: Content is distributed and cached efficiently, significantly reducing hosting costs.

![:bulb:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f4a1.png) Use Cases  

*   Secure archival and streaming of premium video content.
*   Monetization through token rewards and affiliate-linked video commerce.
*   Integration with virtual influencers and AI-generated media.
*   Platform migration for creators restricted by centralized platforms.

![:jigsaw:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f9e9.png) System Architecture  

*   Frontend: Web interface for users and creators with login, video upload, search, and playback features.
*   Backend: IPFS Gateway handles video storage, encryption, access control, and interactions with the JANCTION blockchain.
*   Cache Management: AI-based CDN optimization to ensure smooth video playback without excessive costs.

![:rocket:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f680.png) Development Roadmap  
Phase 1 – Basic Frontend (Feb–Apr)  

*   Creator video uploads
*   Video streaming and sharing
*   User registration & social login
*   Search & recommendation engine

Phase 2 – IPFS Gateway (Mar–Jul)  

*   Decentralized storage and retrieval
*   Blockchain transaction logs via JANCTION Node
*   Secure encryption/decryption support

Phase 3 – Cache Management (Apr–Aug)  

*   Real-time access-based caching
*   AI-based content preloading for trend optimization

![:wrench:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f527.png) Future Scope  

*   Mobile app development for Android/iOS
*   Integration of JCP-based paid viewing
*   Video shopping and affiliate e-commerce features

If you are interested in building censorship-resistant, creator-first video platforms, we welcome contributions and feedback from developers, creators, and decentralization advocates.

### Key Features

*   **Decentralized Storage with IPFS**  
    All music data is permanently stored using IPFS, ensuring durability, censorship resistance, and decentralized access.
    
*   **Proof of Resource Blockchain**  
    JANCTION is built on a novel blockchain architecture where nodes contribute GPU resources to store and retrieve multimedia data.
    
*   **Token Economy (Watch/Listen to Earn)**  
    Users earn points and tokens simply by watching or listening to content. These points can be exchanged for products, services, or even cash via DMC Coin.
    
*   **Integrated Wallet**  
    A custom wallet solution bridges Web2 and Web3, allowing even non-crypto users to participate without installing special apps.
    
*   **Target Audience**  
    This project is especially beneficial for club DJs, music producers, and indie artists looking to share and monetize their work securely and independently.

🧩 IPFS Node Integration
------------------------

### Purpose

The IPFS Node is responsible for storing, pinning, and serving music data within the JANCTION ecosystem. It supports decentralized content delivery and works as a gateway between the user-facing frontend and the storage layer.

### Directory Structure

⚙️ Setup Guide (for IPFS Node)
------------------------------

> Requirements:
> 
> *   Node.js (v18 or higher)
>     
> *   IPFS CLI or Kubo Daemon
>     
> *   Linux or macOS (recommended)
>     

### 1\. Clone the Repository

`git clone https://github.com/your-org/dmc-with-janction.git
cd dmc-with-janction/ipfs-node` 

### 2\. Install Dependencies

`npm install` 

### 3\. Start IPFS Daemon (in separate terminal)

`ipfs init
ipfs daemon` 

### 4\. Launch the Node Server

`npm start` 

This will start the local server on `http://localhost:3000`, exposing endpoints like:

*   `POST /upload` — Upload audio and receive CID
    
*   `GET /file/:cid` — Retrieve stored file using CID
    

### 5\. (Optional) Pin Files Manually

`ipfs add ./music/track1.mp3
ipfs pin add `
